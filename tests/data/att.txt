OBJECTIVE: Long-term outcomes of vein morphologies in the endoscopic vein harvesting setting are lacking. We analyzed 15-year follow-up for endoscopic versus open vein harvesting and associated vein morphology outcomes in coronary artery bypass grafting at a single center. METHODS: This single-center, prospectively collected, retrospective, observational study evaluated 15-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) of endoscopic versus open vein harvesting and associated vein morphologies. RESULTS: Among 729 patients, no differences were found between endoscopic and open vein harvesting in MACE hazard ratios despite increased risks with native Hawai'ian, Pacific Islander, and Filipino patients. Asian and Filipino patients had more thin-walled veins and Asian and multirace patients had more vasovasoral branches than White patients. Bifid veins were associated with increased risk of cardiac catheterization. Varicose veins were associated with myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and death. Thick-walled veins were associated with revascularization and dense adhesions with cardiac catheterization and revascularization. CONCLUSIONS: Fifteen-year adjusted MACE was similar between endoscopic and open vein harvesting in small coronary targets despite increased risks with native Hawai'ian, Pacific Islander, and Filipino patients. Bifid, varicose, thick-walled veins, and dense adhesions had worse MACE.
BACKGROUND: For patients with varicose veins, the goal is to relieve pain and swelling, reduce the severity of edema, improve skin changes, and heal ulcers associated with venous disease. Compression therapy is the cornerstone of their management. Several studies have shown that wearing an elastic bandage for the first 24 h and then a compression stocking for a week can effectively reduce the pain after thermal ablation. However, in clinical practice, patient compliance with this treatment could be better, considering difficulties in pulling up and removing the compression stocking, tightness, and skin irritation because these must be worn for a prolonged period. A potential solution to battling these barriers is short-term compression therapy. Besides, the effect and necessity of wearing compression stockings after thermal ablation have been questioned. Based on current clinical experience and limited evidence, although some scholars have suggested that compression therapy may be an unnecessary adjunctive therapy after thermal ablation, there is still a great deal of uncertainty in the absence of compression therapy after thermal ablation compared to compression therapy. Therefore, we advocate further research to evaluate the clinical effect of short-term postoperative compression therapy. Furthermore, well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of target vein occlusion rate at 3 months. Three hundred and sixty patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatments: (A) 3 M Coban elastic bandage for 48 h or (B) 3 M Coban elastic bandage for the first 24 h and then a class II compression full-length stocking (23-32 mm Hg) for 1 week. The two groups will be compared on several variables, including target vein occlusion rate at 3 months (primary outcome indicator), pain, quality of life, clinical severity of varicose veins, postoperative complications, time to return to regular work, and compliance. DISCUSSION: Suppose the effect of the 3 M Coban elastic bandage for 48 h proves to be non-inferior to long-term compression therapy. In that case, this short-term treatment may contribute to a future update of clinical guidelines for compression therapy after thermal ablation of varicose veins, resulting in higher patient compliance and better postoperative quality of life. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials NCT05840991 . Registered on May 2023.
BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a modified surgical procedure for the treatment of varicose veins. METHODS: This retrospective analysis was conducted on lower extremities with symptomatic great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence that underwent stripping from the groin to the knee, with preservation of the superficial epigastric vein (SEV), between January 2015 and April 2022. Follow-up assessments were performed using Doppler ultrasound, Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), and the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) at 6 and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: The study included 179 limbs from 120 patients (47 men and 73 women). The mean patient age was 56.5 years (range, 20-78 years), and the distribution of preoperative Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology clinical classes was 8% C0-C1, 88% C2, and 4% C3-C6. The preoperative diameter of the saphenofemoral confluence averaged 6.9 mm (range, 2.7-15.8 mm). After a mean postoperative follow-up period of 24 months, evidence of neovascularization around the stump of the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) was observed in 2 limbs (1.1%). Additionally, varicose vein recurrence was found in 1 limb (0.6%) and was associated with an incompetent thigh perforator. At postoperative follow-up, both VCSS and AVVQ scores were significantly lower than the preoperative scores. CONCLUSION: Modified surgical treatment of GSV incompetence, involving preservation of the SEV and stripping of a short segment up to the knee, demonstrated favorable clinical results in terms of postoperative complication rate, neovascularization rate around the SFJ stump, varicose vein recurrence rate, and improvement in lower extremity symptoms.
An autopsy of pancreatic cancer in a woman who died from acute posthemorrhagic anemia due to repeated bleeding from esophageal varices is presented. The mechanism of development of esophageal varices associated with the so-called left-sided portal hypertension, caused by compression of the splenic vein by the tumor and the opening of porto-caval anastomoses, is considered. A brief review discusses other possible causes of left-sided portal hypertension syndrome and its consequences.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of cyanoacrylate closure (CAC) for treating incompetent great saphenous veins compared to radiofrequency ablation (RFA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, randomized controlled study, 248 symptomatic subjects with incompetent great saphenous veins were assigned to either cyanoacrylate closure or radiofrequency ablation. The primary endpoint, complete closure of the target great saphenous vein, was determined using a duplex ultrasound examination. RESULT: In this study, 248 patients (mean age 33.64+/- 8.06 years including 71% women) were treated with either CAC (n =128) or RFA (n = 120) between August 2018 to May 2022. As a follow-up, after a one-month duration, the closure rates were 128/128 at the CAC and 154/158 at the RFA. At month 24, closure rates were 122/128 at CAC and 146/158 at RFA. Apart from phlebitis and pigmentation, the incidences of bruising, skin burn, and paresthesia were lower in the CAC group compared to the RFA group. The mean procedural times were shorter for CAC. The satisfaction level with the treatment was moderately higher among CAC patients than RAF patients. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that Cyanoacrylate glue closure of the great saphenous vein and RFA are effective techniques for managing primary varicose veins. Cyanoacrylate glue closure of the great saphenous vein appears to have a lower rate of complications and higher satisfaction levels, rapid return to normal activities, and improved procedure time without the need for perivenous tumescent anesthesia and post-procedure compression stockings when compared to RFA.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of minimally invasive methods for the treatment of incompetent great saphenous vein and perforating veins. METHODS: Between December 2019 and October 2020, F-care radiofrequency ablation combined with ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy and residual perforator ligation and concomitant microphlebectomy were adopted for all eligible patients. The clinical symptoms scores, complications, and quality of life were recorded. RESULTS: 49 patients (64 limbs) with a mean age of 63.29 +/- 10.14 years, and 60.9%(4) were male. The 1-year truncal closure rate was 63/64 (98.4%).(1) A significant improvement in the Venous Disability Score, the Venous Segmental Disease Score, the Venous Clinical Severity Score and Chronic Venous Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire Score, at 12 months after the combination of minimally invasive treatment, were observed in the study. One patient developed intermuscular vein thrombosis that was successfully managed with rivaroxaban. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of minimally invasive methods is a safe and effective method for the treatment of lower extremity varicose veins. Further large-scale, prospective, multi-center studies are needed to further verify the findings of this study.
INTRODUCTION: Presence of varices after operative treatment (PREVAIT) is a common finding after varicose vein surgery, and has been shown to significantly reduce the quality of life of those it affects. As such, long-term results after varicose vein interventions have to be taken into account when choosing a technique. This study aims to systematically review current evidence on the recurrence of varicose veins after three different techniques: conventional surgery (HLS), endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search was performed on the PubMed and Web of Science databases, which returned 546 studies. Fourteen studies were included. Data were extracted using predefined forms. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 2795 patients were included, for a total of 3056 legs treated. 503 legs (16.5%) were treated by HLS, 1791 (58.6%) by EVLA and 762 (25.0%) by RFA. PREVAIT was reported in 34.4% for patients treated by HLS, for a mean follow-up comprised between 18 months and 5 years; 16.6% by EVLA, for a mean follow-up between 112 days and 5 years and 6.7% of those treated by RFA, for a mean follow-up between 106 days and 5 years. Regarding patterns of recurrence, the development of new varicose veins was the most commonly reported mechanism of recurrence after HLS (range: 29.8-91%) and EVLA (range: 40-81.6%), but not RFA, where recanalization of the occluded saphenous trunk accounted for up to 67.0% of the cases. Only one study reported quality of life related recurrence, and included patients treated by HLS and EVLA, but not RFA. Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) score, physical functioning domains of the SF-36 score and patient satisfaction were significantly worse in patients with clinical recurrence. Re-intervention rates after recurrence were reported in 5 studies, ranging between 7.7% and 37.7% for HLS and 0-57.0% for EVLA. Only one study reported data on re-intervention for RFA patients, which was 6.67%. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence is a reliable indicator of long-term efficacy of a varicose vein treatment and appears to occur more frequently after HLS. Although there are several mechanisms of recurrence, the development of new varicose veins was the most commonly observed. There is clear heterogeneity among definitions of recurrence and follow-up periods in literature.
To investigate the prevalence of multimorbidity and complex multimorbidity and their association with sociodemographic and health variables in individuals with severe obesity. This is a baseline data analysis of 150 individuals with severe obesity (body mass index >/= 35.0 kg/m(2)) aged 18-65 years. The outcomes were multimorbidity and complex multimorbidity. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, anthropometric and self-perceived health data were collected. Poisson multiple regression was conducted to identify multimorbidity risk factors. The frequency of two or more morbidities was 90.7%, three or more morbidities was 76.7%, and complex multimorbidity was 72.0%. Living with four or more household residents was associated with >/= 3 morbidities and complex multimorbidity. Fair and very poor self-perceived health was associated with >/= 2 morbidities, >/= 3 morbidities and complex multimorbidity. A higher BMI range (45.0-65.0 kg/m(2)) was associated with >/= 2 morbidities and >/= 3 morbidities. Anxiety (82.7%), varicose veins of lower limbs (58.7%), hypertension (56.0%) were the most frequent morbidities, as well as the pairs and triads including them. The prevalence of multimorbidity and complex multimorbidity in individuals with severe obesity was higher and the risk for multimorbidity and complex multimorbidity increased in individuals living in households of four or more residents, with fair or poor/very poor self-perceived health and with a higher BMI.

Objective: Due to the potential of thrombus blockage and aneurysm rupture, saphenous veins with varicose veins are not advised for use as bypass grafts. However, if no other autologous vein is accessible for use as a conduit in lower-limb bypass; varicose vein transplants may be employed. Few reports have studied the clinical results of lower-limb bypass using varicose vein grafts. We therefore investigated whether or not acceptable patency rates of varicose vein graft for lower-limb bypass could be achieved. Methods: We performed lower-limb bypass using varicose vein graft on nine limbs from June 2017 to May 2020 and conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Results: Early graft failure following bypass surgery using a varicose vein transplant was not detected, and major complications, such as acute graft occlusion or aneurysm dilatation, were not noted throughout the follow-up period. The primary and secondary patency of varicose vein graft was 70.0% and 100% at 3 years, respectively. Conclusion: The incidence of major problems of the varicose vein transplants does not seem to be higher than with conventional saphenous vein grafts. If there are no other appropriate autologous veins, a varicose vein graft may be useful as a conduit for bypass surgery.
Insufficiency of the small saphenous vein causes 15% of varicose veins in the lower extremities. Endovenous ablation for the treatment of small saphenous vein varices has become a trend, and an increasing number of studies have reported the effects of different types of endovenous ablation in patients with small saphenous varicose veins. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the results of existing studies on endovenous ablation for the treatment of small saphenous varicose veins, compare its role and efficacy, and provide insights into the future development of endovenous ablation for treating small saphenous varicose veins. A systematic review of literature published from January 1, 2002 to January 1, 2022 was conducted from PubMed, Embase, and China Academic Journals full-text databases. The pre-determined inclusion criteria were clinical literature of endovenous ablation for treating small saphenous varicose veins. Keywords included "ablation", "small saphenous vein", "lesser saphenous vein", "short saphenous vein", "xiaoyinjingmai" and "xiaorong". Of the 506 articles screened, 33 articles were included in this review: 19 articles were related to endovenous laser ablation, five were related to mechanochemical ablation, seven were related to radiofrequency ablation, and two were related to both endovenous laser ablation and radiofrequency ablation. The anatomical success rate of endovenous laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, and mechanochemical ablation were 94.3%, 96.0%, and 88.1%, respectively, and the heterogeneities were all moderate. Most of the current studies are of a low-quality level of research. Hence, long-term follow-up studies and large-scale randomized controlled trials are required to obtain high-quality evidence. Although the gold standard for the treatment of small saphenous vein insufficiency remains unclear, endovenous ablation is still the recommended method.
Background: There are no data on the daily regimen of compression therapy in patients with chronic venous disease. This systematic review aimed to establish the optimal daily duration of compression treatment. Methods: A systematic search of CENTRAL and MEDLINE was performed to identify RCTs, non-RCTs, reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines evaluating the use of compression regimens in the treatment of varicose veins. Results: Thirty-two RCTs, three non-RCTs, four observational studies, and two crossover trials reporting the duration and regimes of compression treatment fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The daily duration of compression was reported in patients after invasive treatment, for venous ulcer treatment, in patients with venous symptoms. The quality of the studies varied. We could not conduct a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of the research data and their quality. Twenty-three studies reported results of compression usage after invasive procedures. Eight studies reported daily duration regimens in patients with venous ulcers. Nine studies reported the impact of compression on venous symptoms and/or edema or limb volume change. One study was conducted to assess if compression improves QoL in venous patients. While there was a clear difference found in the daily duration depending on the clinical scenario, no data in support of exact regimens were found. Conclusions: There are no reliable data supporting exact daily regimens of compression treatment in various cohorts of CVD patients.
Cyanoacrylate glue is a non-thermal, non-tumescent agent used to treat saphenous reflux. It was introduced to overcome heat-related discomfort and complications. Multiple randomized controlled trials using this therapy have demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes at long-term follow-up. However, diffuse injection-site inflammation and systemic urticaria are worrisome complications. In preclinical studies, serial histopathological findings demonstrated acute inflammatory reaction, subacute vasculitis, chronic granulomatous foreign body reaction, fibrotic changes with partial vascular recanalization, and chronic foreign body-type inflammatory response. While the exact nature of this unique complication remains undefined, complex hypersensitivity and irritation reaction phenomena have been suggested based on reported clinical presentations. The incidence of this complication has been reported as ranging from 0.3%-25.4%. Typically, erythematous reactions can occur near treatment sites, with symptoms ranging from mild pruritus and/or erythema that resolves without treatment to recurrent severe inflammation and pruritus requiring nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, and/or corticosteroids. Surgical excision has been rarely reported in patients with severe intractable inflammation or treatment-site infections. Although several anecdotal studies reported on using antihistaminics or corticosteroids, no effective strategies have been established to prevent this complication.
Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) is an uncommon condition that predominantly affects the left renal vein (LRV) because of its entrapment between the aorta and superior mesenteric vein. It can result in pain in the left flank or back, hematuria, and proteinuria. May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is described as a condition in which the left common iliac vein is compressed by the right common iliac artery, causing swelling, fullness, venous ulcers, or varicose veins in the leg. We present a case of a 77-year-old female who had these symptoms for over a decade, until she was diagnosed in 2017. Initially, she experienced swelling and pain in her left leg, which began in 2005; however, treatment did not begin until she had her left ovarian vein embolized in 2017. Her symptoms returned the following year, leading to the diagnosis of bilateral MTS. Owing to recurring symptoms in 2022, a repeat venogram revealed bilateral external iliac vein constriction, requiring intervention. She presented to our clinic in 2023 after being referred by her cardiologist because of persistent back pain and venous congestion. This led to the findings and diagnosis of NCS with bilateral MTS.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research was to investigate whether sublingual varices (SV) are associated with new events of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and new events of cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted amongst 1139 dental patients aged between 48 and 84 years across 2 cohorts (201 enrolled from 2010-2013 and 938 from 2018-2020). Participants provided baseline data on demographics, risk factors, and medical diagnoses, followed by an assessment of their tongue's ventral surface to classify veins as either having no sublingual varices (nSV) or having sublingual varices (SV). Information regarding medical diagnoses was gathered during the follow-up period from both participants and their medical records. The primary outcome variables were the onset of new IHD and new cerebrovascular disease events. Comparisons were made between participants with SV and nSV. RESULTS: The study population comprised 54% women with an average age of 66 years. SV were present in 33% of participants. Those with SV predominantly were male, older, and smokers; had a higher body mass index, and exhibited more instances of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia than those with nSV. New occurrences of IHD (4.5% vs 1.8%, P = .009) and cerebrovascular disease (4.2% vs 2.0%, P = .026) were more prevalent in the SV group compared with the nSV group. The link between SV and new IHD events persisted even after adjustments for sex, age, and smoking habits (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.074.76), but not for new cerebrovascular disease events (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 0.843.71). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies a correlation between SV and new events of IHD, but not new events of cerebrovascular disease. The detection of SV occurred prior to the IHD events, suggesting a temporal relationship. This novel finding proposes a potential shared pathophysiology between IHD and SV.
BACKGROUND: Varicose veins (VV) are a prevalent chronic venous disorder, particularly affecting women of childbearing age. This condition is associated with significant complications, including pain, discomfort, leg cramps, ulceration, reduced quality of life, absenteeism, and even mortality. This study aims to develop a custom non-invasive, non-contact optical imaging system combined with magnitude and phase image calculation to monitor and visualize varicose veins and their tributaries using hyperspectral imaging and quantitative phase analysis with a k-means clustering algorithm. RESULTS: Ten volunteers participated in the optical imaging system study. They were exposed to a polychromatic light source spanning the wavelength range of 400 nm to 950 nm. The diffuse reflection spectra for varicose veins exhibited a peak at 530 nm, while leg veins showed a peak at 780 nm. Hyperspectral images obtained at these specific wavelengths were normalized in order to homogenize the spectral signatures of each pixel (converting the hyperspectral image to 8 bit RGB image) and filtered using a moving average filter. Subsequently, the varicose veins and leg veins were delineated and detected using quantitative phase analysis and a k-means clustering algorithm. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the custom optical imaging system, utilizing hyperspectral imaging and the associated clustering algorithm, provides detailed information regarding the spatial distribution of varicose veins. This information can assist vascular physicians in facilitating easier diagnosis and treatment planning.
BACKGROUND: Iliac vein compression syndrome (IVCS) is an underlying cause of varicose vein (VV) recurrence after venous surgery. However, the management of recurrent varicose veins (RVVs) combined with IVCS has rarely been reported. This study aimed to investigate the outcomes of a one-stop procedure to correct outflow obstruction and superficial reflux for patients with RVVs and IVCS. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 102 consecutive patients diagnosed with RVVs. Computed tomography venography (CTV) was performed to confirm IVCS. The cases were divided into 2 groups: the IRVVs group, including patients with RVVs and IVCS (n=48), and the RVVs group, including patients with RVVs only (n=54). The characteristics, vein reflux, and clinical, etiological, anatomical, and pathophysiological (CEAP) distribution were investigated. Then, the IRVVs group patients who underwent endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) (n=39) were divided into a further 2 groups: the EVLA + S group (n=19), who received EVLA and stenting of iliac vein, and the EVLA group (n=20), who received EVLA treatment alone. The great/small saphenous vein (GSV/SSV) trunk occlusion, VV recurrence, visual analogue scale (VAS), and venous clinical severity score (VCSS) were investigated. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of femoral vein reflux was 81.2% in IRVVs group and 50% in RVVs group (P<0.05). In the IRVVs group, 72.9% of patients manifested as CEAP clinical class >3, which was higher than that in RVVs group (48.1%) (P<0.05). The 12-month GSV/SSV occlusion rate in the EVLA + S and EVLA groups were 94.7% and 90.0%, respectively. Totals of 9 patients in EVLA + S group and 6 patients in EVLA group had active venous ulcers, and the ulcer healing time in EVLA + S group was significantly shorter (27.22+/-7.12 vs. 46.67+/-9.83 days, P<0.05). The reductions in the VAS and VCSS values between baseline, 1 month, and 12 months in the EVLA + S group were more obvious than those in EVLA group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The one-stop combination treatment of iliac venous stenting and EVLA in patients with RVVs and IVCS is safe and effective and provides prominent symptom relief, improved quality of life, and a more satisfactory ulcer healing than EVLA alone.
OBJECTIVE: Varicose veins have a significant impact on quality of life and can commonly occur in the thigh and calves. However, there has been no large-scale investigation examining the relationship between anatomic distribution and outcomes after varicose vein treatment. This study sought to compare below-the-knee (BTK) and above-the-knee (ATK) varicose vein treatment outcomes. METHODS: Employing the Vascular Quality Initiative Varicose Vein Registry, 13,731 patients undergoing varicose vein ablation for either BTK or ATK lesions were identified. Outcomes were assessed using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). Continuous variables were compared using the t-test, and categorical variables were analyzed using the chi(2) test. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of improvement after intervention. The multivariable model controlled for age, gender, race, preoperative VCSS composite score, and history of deep vein thrombosis. RESULTS: Patients who received below-knee treatment had a lower preoperative VCSS composite (7.0 +/- 3.3 vs 7.7 +/- 3.3; P < .001) and lower PROs composite scores (11.1 +/- 6.4 vs 13.0 +/- 6.6; P < .001) compared with those of patients receiving above-knee treatment. However, on follow-up, patients receiving below-knee intervention had a higher postoperative VCSS composite score (4.4 +/- 3.3 vs 3.9 +/- 3.5; P < .001) and PROs composite score (6.1 +/- 4.4 vs 5.8 +/- 4.5; P = .007), the latter approaching statistical significance. Patients receiving above-knee interventions also demonstrated more improvement in both composite VCSS (3.8 +/- 4.0 vs 2.9 +/- 3.7; P < .001) and PROs (7.1 +/- 6.8 vs 4.8 +/- 6.6; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis similarly revealed that patients receiving above-knee treatment had significantly higher odds of improvement in VCSS composite in both the unadjusted (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-1.65; P < .001 and adjusted (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14-1.50; P < .001) models. Patients receiving above-knee treatment also had a significantly higher odds of reporting improvement in PROs composite in both the unadjusted (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.64-2.11; P < .001) and adjusted (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.45-1.88; P < .001) models. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment region has a significant association with PROs and VCSS composite scores after varicose vein interventions. Preoperatively, there were significant differences in the composite scores of VCSS and PROs with patients receiving BTK treatment exhibiting less severe symptoms. Yet, the association appeared to reverse postoperatively, with those receiving BTK treatments exhibiting worse PROs, worse VCSS composites scores, and less improvement in VCSS composite scores. Therefore, BTK interventions pose a unique challenge compared with ATK interventions in ensuring commensurate clinical improvement after treatment.
RATIONALE: Hesperidin (HES) is a well-known citrus bioflavonoid phyto-nutraceutical agent with polypharmacological properties. After 2019, HES was widely used for prophylaxis and COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, it is commonly prescribed for treating varicose veins and other diseases in routine clinical practice. Pharmaceutical impurities and degradation products (DP) impact the drug's quality and safety and thus its effectiveness. Therefore, forced degradation studies help study drug stability, degradation mechanisms, and their DPs. This study was performed because stress stability studies using detailed structural characterization of hesperidin are currently unavailable in the literature. METHODS: In the HES enrichment method crude HES was converted to its pure form (98% purity) using column chromatography and then subjected to forced degradation under acid, base, and neutral hydrolyses followed by oxidative, reductive, photolytic, and thermal stress testing (International Conference on Harmonization guidelines). The stability-indicating analytical method (SIAM) was developed to determine DPs using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (C18 column with methanol and 0.1% v/v acetic acid in deionized water [70:30, v/v] at 284 nm). Further, structural characterization of DPs was performed using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In addition, in silico toxicity predictions were performed using pKCSM and DataWarior freeware. RESULTS: HES was found to be susceptible to acidic and basic hydrolytic conditions and yielded three DPs in each, which were detected using designed SIAM. Of six DPs, three were pseudo-DPs (short lived), and the remaining were characterized using LC-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. The tentative mechanism of the formation of proposed DPs was explained. The proposed DPs were found inactive from in silico toxicity predictions. CONCLUSIONS: Hesperidin was labile under acidic and basic stress conditions. The potential DPs were characterized using LC-ESI-MS/MS and NMR spectral techniques. The proposed mechanism of formation was hypothesized. In addition, to identify and characterize the DPs, a SIAM, which has broad biomedical applications, was successfully developed.
OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of the acupuncture of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in the treatment of lower extremity varicose veins (LEVVs). METHODS: Overall, 260 patients with LEVVs participated in this study. LEVVs were selected based on diagnostic criteria of Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology levels 2-5 and classified into six types on the basis of their anatomical positions. The MTrPs in the lower extremities were localized in accordance with the classification of LEVVs and treated by MTrPs acupuncture combined with self-massage and self-stretching. The interval between each treatment was 2 weeks to 1 month, depending on needling pain tolerance of each patient. An in-house evaluation was used to estimate the proportion of varicose veins in the lower limbs and their accompanying symptoms. The treatment effect was evaluated before each treatment and at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: The mean evaluation score of LEVVs before the treatment course was 3.66 +/- 1.19. After the course, this reduced to 1.18 +/- 0.97, with the following response rates: 85% for excellent and good and 15% for medium. After 1-year follow-up, the mean evaluation score of all patients was 1.11 +/- 0.92, with the following response rates: 87% for excellent and good, and 13% for medium. CONCLUSIONS: In some patients, MTrP acupuncture could cure LEVVs and its accompanying symptoms. These LEVVs are probably caused by fascia tension as a pre-pathology induced by the MTrPs.
BACKGROUND: Vein ablation is a common and effective treatment for patients with chronic venous insufficiency. The overuse of vein ablation despite the existence of evidence-based guidelines has resulted in insurance companies developing restrictive policies for coverage that create barriers to appropriate care. This study compares the insurance coverage by single-state carriers (SSCs) and multistate carriers (MSCs), highlighting the variations and inconsistencies in the various policies. METHODS: The American Venous Forum Venous Policy Navigator was reviewed for the various policies available in the United States. The policies were divided into SSCs and MSCs. The characteristics of the policies, including the anatomic and hemodynamic criteria for specific veins, duration of conservative treatment, disease severity, symptoms, and types of procedures covered, were compared between the two groups. SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 122 policies were analyzed and divided between SSCs (n = 85; 69.7%) and MSCs (n = 37; 30.3%). A significant variation was found in the size requirement for great saphenous vein ablation. Although 48% of the policies did not specify a size criterion, the remaining policies indicated a minimal size, ranging from 3 to 5.5 mm. However, no significant differences were found between SSCs and MSCs. Similar findings were encountered for the small and anterior accessory saphenous veins. MSCs were more likely to define a saphenous reflux time >500 ms compared with SSCs (81.1% vs 58.8%; P = .04). A significant difference was found between the SSCs and MSCs in the criteria for perforator ablation in terms of size and reflux time. MSCs were significantly more likely to provide coverage for mechanochemical ablation than were SSCs (24.3% vs 8.2%; P = .03). SSCs were more likely to require >/=12 weeks of compression stocking therapy than were MSCs (76.5% vs 48.7%; P = .01). No significant differences were found in the clinical indications between the two groups; however, MSCs were more likely to mention major hemorrhage than were SSCs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight the variations in policies for venous ablation, in particular, the striking inconsistencies in size criteria. MSCs were more likely to cover mechanochemical ablation and require a shorter duration of conservative therapy before intervention compared with SSCs. Evidence-based guidance is needed to develop more coherent policies for venous ablation coverage.
OBJECTIVE: Recanalization of the saphenous vein trunk after endovenous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is often associated with recurrent varicose veins (RVVs) or recanalization. This study aimed to assess the long-term results of RFA of the great saphenous vein (GSV) and identify the risk factors for GSV recanalization and RVVs during follow-up for patients presenting to dedicated outpatient vein centers. METHODS: All consecutive patients with incompetent GSVs who underwent RFA between 2009 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary study end points were freedom from GSV recanalization and the RVV rate during follow-up. The secondary study end points were the postoperative complication rate and the risk factors for GSV recanalization and RVVs. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the potential risk factors for GSV recanalization and RVVs. RESULTS: During the study period, 1568 limbs were treated in 1300 consecutive patients (mean age, 53.5 +/- 12.9 years; 71.9% women; CEAP [clinical, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology] C2-C6; venous clinical severity score >5). Technical success was achieved in 99.7% of cases. At a mean follow-up of 57.2 +/- 25.4 months, the GSV occlusion and freedom from reintervention rates were 100% and 100% within 1 week, 97% and 95.7% at 1 year, 95.2% and 93.1% at 3 years, and 92.4% and 92.8% at 5 years, respectively. The recurrence rate was 10% (n = 158) during the follow-up period. On multivariate analysis, a direct confluence of the accessory saphenous vein into the saphenofemoral junction (odds ratio [OR], 1.561; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-7.04; P = .032), a history of pregnancy >2 (OR, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.19-11.36; P = .023), C4 (OR, 6.41; 95% CI, 1.36-30.28; P = .019), and preoperative GSV diameter >10 mm (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.65-4.03; P = .043) were risk factors for GSV recanalization. Moreover, age >70 years (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; P = .014) and incompetent perforator veins (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.65-2.03; P = .018) were also risk factors for RVVs. CONCLUSIONS: RFA is a safe technique to ablate the GSV with a low complication rate and durability during 5 years of follow-up. However, patients with a high clinical score and those with direct confluence of the accessory saphenous vein into the saphenofemoral junction experienced higher long-term GSV recanalization and RVV rates.
BACKGROUND: Varicose veins commonly occur on the legs and cause discomfort, pain, and aesthetic issues. Varicose vein surgery has an significant impact on sleep disorders such as Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), daytime sleepiness (DS), and sleep quality (SQ). We intended to determine if preoperative and postoperative sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and RLS severity impacted in those who had varicose vein surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research included 160 patients who presented to the Cardiovascular Surgery outpatient clinic with symptoms of leg pain and cramping and were diagnosed with venous insufficiency. The Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale (RLSS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) tests were performed on patients. The patients' scores on the scales were compared preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: The mean age of the 160 patients was calculated to be 48.7 +/- 10.6 years. There were 109 female (68.1%) and 51 male (31.9%). The mean ferritin level of the patients was calculated as 61.4 mL/ng (4.3-421 mL/ng). After varicose vein surgery 63% reported improved sleep quality. Individuals with increased DS had lower postoperative RLSS scores and higher SQ. There was a decrease in postoperative RLSS scores and an increase in postoperative SQ in patients with normal DS (p < 0.001). Postoperative RLSS and DS scores were lower in patients with good SQ (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients had a lower RLSS score, a lower DS score, and a higher SQ after varicose vein surgery. Surgical treatment is critical to improving the quality of life and sleep comfort of patients with varicose veins and sleep disorders.
OBJECTIVE: Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is the most common long-term complication in patients with deep venous thrombosis, and the prevention of PTS remains a major challenge in clinical practice. Some studies have explored early predictors and constructed corresponding prediction models, whereas their specific application and predictive value are controversial. Therefore, we conducted this systematic evaluation and meta-analysis to investigate the incidence of PTS and the feasibility of early prediction. METHODS: We systematically searched databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science up to April 7, 2023. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of the included articles, and the OR values of the predictors in multi-factor logistic regression were pooled to assess whether they could be used as effective independent predictors. RESULTS: We systematically included 20 articles involving 8,512 subjects, with a predominant onset of PTS between 6 and 72 months, with a 2-year incidence of 37.5% (95% CI: 27.8-47.7%). The results for the early predictors were as follows: old age OR = 1.840 (95% CI: 1.410-2.402), obesity or overweight OR = 1.721 (95% CI: 1.245-2.378), proximal deep vein thrombosis OR = 2.335 (95% CI: 1.855-2.938), history of venous thromboembolism OR = 3.593 (95% CI: 1.738-7.240), history of smoking OR = 2.051 (95% CI: 1.305-3.224), varicose veins OR = 2.405 (95% CI: 1.344-4.304), and baseline Villalta score OR = 1.095(95% CI: 1.056-1.135). Meanwhile, gender, unprovoked DVT and insufficient anticoagulation were not independent predictors. Seven studies constructed risk prediction models. In the training set, the c-index of the prediction models was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.74-0.80) with a sensitivity of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.68-0.81) and specificity of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.60-0.77). In the validation set, the c-index, sensitivity and specificity of the prediction models were 0.74(95% CI: 0.69-0.79), 0.71(95% CI: 0.64-0.78) and 0.72(95% CI: 0.67-0.76), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With a high incidence after venous thrombosis, PTS is a complication that cannot be ignored in patients with venous thrombosis. Risk prediction scoring based on early model construction is a feasible option, which helps to identify the patient's condition and develop an individualized prevention program to reduce the risk of PTS.
OBJECTIVES: Chronic venous disease (CVD) of the lower extremities is one of the common venous diseases in different populations, with a wide range of clinical manifestations and undetermined exact prevalence owing to different population characteristics and measurement methods. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of CVD among the modern Iranian urban population and determine its associated risk factors. METHODS: The Heart Assessment and Monitoring in Rajaie Hospital study, a longitudinal population-based cohort, aims to investigate the baseline prevalence and the 10-year incidence of cardiovascular diseases and associated risk factors in the adult population aged 30 to 75 years with no overt cardiovascular diseases in Tehran. Two instructed interventional cardiologists performed CVD evaluation using the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology classification. CVD was graded as C1 to C6, and chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) as C3 to C6. A multivariable regression model was used to analyze the association between CVD and prespecified covariates of age, sex, body mass index (>/=30 kg/m(2)), smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, physical activity, dyslipidemia, and delivery method. RESULTS: CVD prevalence among 1176 participants was 36.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33.8-39.3) and was higher in women than men (44.2% vs 23.5%). CVI prevalence was only 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3-1.3). Multivariable analysis showed that advanced age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04-1.08), female sex (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 2.14-4.14), and body mass index of >/=30 (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.03-1.81) were independently associated with CVD. Physical activity (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58-1.02) was nearly protective, whereas other factors, including traditional cardiovascular risk factors, had no meaningful association with CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that CVD was prevalent in the modern Iranian urban population. However, considering the very low prevalence of the higher stages of the disease, the benefit of mass screening is debatable, and better risk discriminators should be investigated.

This narrative review of the literature, consisting of papers found in PubMed and The Cochrane Library published up to 31 July 2023, analyzed those that were deemed to be closely related to the title of this paper. It was encountered that the peril of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in people with hemophilia (PWH) after orthopedic surgery is very small, such that pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is not necessary in most cases. The hemophilia literature states that the use of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis should only be performed in PWH undergoing major orthopedic surgery (total-knee arthroplasty, total-hip arthroplasty, ankle arthrodesis) who have additional venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk factors, such as old age, prior VTE, varicose veins, general anesthesia, cancer, factor V (Leiden) mutation, overweight, and treatment with the oral contraceptive pill (in females with von Willebrand's illness). If we notice various risk factors for VTE in PWH who experience orthopedic surgery, theoretically, we should perform the identical type of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis advised for non-hemophilia patients: low-molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), such as enoxaparin (40 mg subcutaneous/24 h); or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), either thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran, 150 mg oral/12 h) or activated factor X (FXa) inhibitors (rivaroxaban, 20 mg oral/24 h; apixaban, 5 mg oral/24 h), or subcutaneous fondaparinux (2.5 mg/24 h subcutaneously). However, the review of the literature on hemophiliac patients has shown that only a few authors have used pharmacological prophylaxis with LMWH (subcutaneous enoxaparin) for a short period of time (10-14 days) in some patients who had risk factors for VTE. Only one group of authors used a low dose of DOAC in the dusk after the surgical procedure and the next day, specifically in individuals at elevated risk of VTE and elevated risk of bleeding after the surgical procedure.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine whether body weight may affect the effectiveness and safety of endovenous thermal ablation (ETA) for the treatment of symptomatic varicose veins. METHODS: This retrospective single-center cohort study analyzed the outcomes and patient demographic data with a focus on the body weight of all patients who had ETA of symptomatic varicose veins between September 2017 and October 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1178 treated truncal veins from 636 patients were analyzed. The mean +/- standard deviation body mass index (BMI) was 25.5 +/- 4.9. In 2.3% of cases, the patients were underweight (BMI < 18.5), 31.0% were overweight (BMI > 25), and 16.6% were obese (BMI > 30). Complete truncal occlusion was observed 1 year post intervention in 97.6-100% and patients were satisfied or very satisfied in 96.2-100% across BMI groups. Pain was low but significantly higher in the patients with obesity 6 weeks post intervention (visual analog scale 0.84 +/- 1.49) and a higher infection rate was observed in the patients with obesity (n = 4/132; 3.0%). No significant association was observed between BMI and bleeding or thromboembolic events. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with obesity experienced prolonged pain and more infections after ETA, but ETA for varicose vein treatment remains effective and safe, independent of the patient's BMI.
OBJECTIVES: The addition of a varicose veins (VV) module to the existing Swedish National Registry for Vascular Surgery (Swedvasc) and its impact on quality of care were evaluated. METHODS: Vascular departments and private VV clinics were invited to enter data from 2016. RESULTS: Registrations were approximately 10,000 yearly but dropped to 5390 in 2022 when a fee was introduced for private clinics due to reduced funding. 88% more interventions were reported to Swedvasc 2020 than to the National Board of Health and Welfare. Regions differed in interventions per 100,000 inhabitants/year from 21 to 233 and in preoperative CEAP C4-6 from 30.8%-90.4%. Follow-up was 9.4%. These data contributed to the decision to prioritize the patient group for national guidelines and pathways of care, which will be monitored by Swedvasc. CONCLUSIONS: A national VV registry with high coverage is possible and can contribute to national quality of care. The main challenge is funding.
Introduction: Dawali (varicose veins) is the disease of chronic dilation of veins. The veins of the legs become dilated and blue due to excessive accumulation of blood. This disease and the effort to identify and treat it has a very long history. The condition may have first been described in the Ebers Papyrus more than 3500 years ago. The present study deals with the turning points and progress of varicose vein surgery since ancient times, emphasizing the innovations of the scholars of the Islamic period.Methods: The present study is based on searching library documents and database data such as PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and search engines such as Google Scholar. In the end, the Prisma flow chart was drawn.Results: Besides diagnosing different varicose veins (legs, thighs, abdomen, uterus, and testes), the scholars of the Islamic period were well-versed in their prevention, etiology, and treatment. In treating varicose veins, these physicians used methods such as cleansing, phlebotomy, compression, leech therapy, and surgery, and some of them were the founders of new treatments.Conclusion: The surgical treatment of varicose veins in the past was similar to modern surgical therapies. What distinguishes yesterday's varicose vein surgery from today's surgery is a more advanced tool. There is no denying the remarkable progress in using health principles, treatment techniques, and surgical instruments to facilitate surgery and reduce the disease's complications and recurrence. However, the treatment framework and foundation, such as phlebectomy and compression, were all invented and introduced in the distant past.
